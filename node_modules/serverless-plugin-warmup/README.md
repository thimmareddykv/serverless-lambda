Keep your lambdas warm during winter.

**Requirements:**
* Serverless *v1.12.x* or higher (Recommended *v1.33.x* or higher because of [this](https://github.com/FidelLimited/serverless-plugin-warmup/pull/69)).
* AWS provider

## How it works

WarmUp solves *cold starts* by creating a scheduled lambda that invokes all the selected service's lambdas in a configured time interval (default: 5 minutes) and forcing your containers to stay warm.

## Installation

Install via npm in the root of your Serverless service:

```sh
npm install --save-dev serverless-plugin-warmup
```

Add the plugin to the `plugins` array in your Serverless `serverless.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-plugin-warmup
```

## Configuration

Most options are set under `custom.warmup` in the `serverless.yaml` file.

* **folderName** (default `_warmup`)
* **cleanFolder** (default `true`)
* **name** (default `${service}-${stage}-warmup-plugin`)
* **role** (default to role in the provider)
* **tags** (default to serverless default tags)
* **vpc** (default to vpc in provider, can be set to `false` to deploy the warmup function outside of VPC)
* **memorySize** (default `128`)
* **events** (default `- schedule: rate(5 minutes)`, can be any [Serverless event](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/))
* **package** (default `package: { individually: true, exclude: ['**'], include: ['_warmup/**'] }`)
* **timeout** (default `10` seconds)
* **environment** (default to unset all package level environment variables. It can be use to set variables or to unset global variables by setting it to undefined. However, you should never have to change the default.)
* **prewarm** (default `false`)

But there are some options which can also be set under `custom.warmup` to be applied to all lambdas to be warmed up or can be overridden on each individual lambda.

* **enabled** (default `false`,an be a boolean, a stage or a list of stages.)
* **payload** (default `{ "source": "serverless-plugin-warmup" }`, payload will be stringified)
* **payloadRaw** (default `false`)
* **concurrency** (default `1`)

```yaml
custom:
  warmup:
    enabled: true # Whether to warm up functions by default or not
    folderName: '_warmup' # Name of the folder created for the generated warmup 
    cleanFolder: false
    memorySize: 256
    name: 'make-them-pop'
    role: myCustRole0
    tags:
      Project: foo
      Owner: bar 
    vpc: false
    events:
      - schedule: 'cron(0/5 8-17 ? * MON-FRI *)' # Run WarmUp every 5 minutes Mon-Fri between 8:00am and 5:55pm (UTC)
    package:
      individually: true
      exclude: # exclude additional binaries that are included at the serverless package level
        - ../**
        - ../../**
      include:
        - ./**
    timeout: 20
    prewarm: true # Run WarmUp immediately after a deploymentlambda
    payload: 
      source: my-custom-source
      other: 20
    payloadRaw: true # Won't JSON.stringify() the payload, may be necessary for Go/AppSync deployments
    concurrency: 5 # Warm up 5 concurrent instances
    
functions:
  myColdfunction:
    handler: 'myColdfunction.handler'
    events:
      - http:
          path: my-cold-function
          method: post
    warmup:
      enabled: false

  myLowConcurrencyFunction:
    handler: 'myLowConcurrencyFunction.handler'
    events:
      - http:
          path: my-low-concurrency-function
          method: post
    warmup:
      payload: different-source-only-for-this-lambda
      concurrency: 1
   
  myProductionOnlyFunction:
    handler: 'myProductionOnlyFunction.handler'
    events:
      - http:
          path: my-production-only-function
          method: post
    warmup:
      enabled: prod
      
   myDevAndStagingOnlyFunction:
    handler: 'myDevAndStagingOnlyFunction.handler'
    events:
      - http:
          path: my-dev-and-staging-only-function
          method: post
    warmup:
      enabled:
        - dev
        - staging
```

##### Options should be tweaked depending on:

* Number of lambdas to warm up
* Day cold periods
* Desire to avoid cold lambdas after a deployment


#### Legacy options

Over time some options have been removed form the pluging.
For now, we keep backwards compatibility so they still work.
However, they are listed here only to facilitate upgrading the pluging and we strongly recommend switching to the options defined above as soon as possible.

* **default** Has been renamed to `enabled`
* **schedule** `schedule: rate(5 minutes)` is equivalent to `events: - schedule: rate(5 minutes)`.
* **source** Has been renamed to `payload`
* **sourceRaw** Has been renamed to `payloadRaw`

### Permissions

WarmUp requires some permissions to be able to `invoke` your lambdas.

```yaml
custom:
  warmup:
    folderName: '_warmup' # Name of the folder created for the generated warmup 
    cleanFolder: false
    memorySize: 256
    name: 'make-them-pop'
    role:  myCustRole0
    events:
      - schedule: 'cron(0/5 8-17 ? * MON-FRI *)' # Run WarmUp every 5 minutes Mon-Fri between 8:00am and 5:55pm (UTC)
    timeout: 20
    prewarm: true # Run WarmUp immediately after a deployment
    tags:
      Project: foo
      Owner: bar

                  - Fn::Join:
                    - ':'
                    - - arn:aws:lambda
                      - Ref: AWS::Region
                      - Ref: AWS::AccountId
                      - function:${self:service}-${opt:stage, self:provider.stage}-*
```

The permissions can also be added to all lambdas using `iamRoleStatements` under `provider` (see https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/functions/#permissions):

```yaml
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs10.x
  iamRoleStatements:
    - Effect: 'Allow'
      Action:
        - 'lambda:InvokeFunction'
      Resource:
      - Fn::Join:
        - ':'
        - - arn:aws:lambda
          - Ref: AWS::Region
          - Ref: AWS::AccountId
          - function:${self:service}-${opt:stage, self:provider.stage}-*
```
If using pre-warm, the deployment user also needs a similar policy so it can run the WarmUp lambda.


## On the function side

Lambdas invoked by WarmUp will have the event source `serverless-plugin-warmup` (unless otherwise specified using the `payload` option):

```json
{
  "Event": {
    "source": "serverless-plugin-warmup"
  }
}
```

To minimize cost and avoid running your lambda unnecessarily, you should add an early return call before your lambda logic when that payload is received.

```javascript
// Using the Promise style
module.exports.lambdaToWarm = async function(event, context) {
  /** Immediate response for WarmUp plugin */
  if (event.source === 'serverless-plugin-warmup') {
    console.log('WarmUp - Lambda is warm!');
    return 'Lambda is warm!';
  }

  ... add lambda logic after
}

// Using the Callback style
module.exports.lambdaToWarm = function(event, context, callback) {
  /** Immediate response for WarmUp plugin */
  if (event.source === 'serverless-plugin-warmup') {
    console.log('WarmUp - Lambda is warm!')
    return callback(null, 'Lambda is warm!')
  }

  ... add lambda logic after
}

// Using context.
// This could be useful if you are handling the raw input and output streams.
module.exports.lambdaToWarm = async function(event, context) {
  /** Immediate response for WarmUp plugin */
  if (context.custom.source === 'serverless-plugin-warmup') {
    console.log('WarmUp - Lambda is warm!');
    return 'Lambda is warm!';
  }

  ... add lambda logic after
}
```

If you're using the `concurrency` option you might want to add a slight delay before returning on warmup calls to ensure that your function doesn't return before all concurrent requests have been started:

```javascript
module.exports.lambdaToWarm = async (event, context) => {
  if (event.source === 'serverless-plugin-warmup') {
    console.log('WarmUp - Lambda is warm!');
    /** Slightly delayed (25ms) response 
    	to ensure concurrent invocation */
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 25));
    return 'Lambda is warm!';
    
  }

  ... add lambda logic after
}
```
## Deployment

WarmUp supports `serverless deploy`.

## Packaging

WarmUp supports `serverless package`.

By default, the WarmUp function is packaged individually and it uses a folder named `_warmup` to store duiring the packaging process, which is deleted at the end of the process.

If you are doing your own [package artifact](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/packaging#artifact) you can set the `cleanFolder` option to `false` and include the `_warmup` folder in your custom artifact.

## Gotchas

The WarmUp function use normal calls to the AWS SDK in order to keep your lambdas warm.
By deafult, the WarmUp function is deployed outside of any VPC so it can reach AWS API.
If you use the VPC option to deploy your WarmUp function to a VPC subnet it will need internet access. You can do it by using an [Internet Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) or a [Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/vpc.html). 

## Cost

You can check the Lambda [pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/) and CloudWatch [pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) or can use the [AWS Lambda Pricing Calculator](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lambda-tools/pricing-calculator.html) to estimate the monthly cost

#### Example

If you want to warm 10 functions, each with `memorySize = 1024` and `duration = 10`, using the default settings (and we ignore the free tier):

* WarmUp: runs 8640 times per month = $0.18
* 10 warm lambdas: each invoked 8640 times per month = $14.4
* Total = $14.58

CloudWatch costs are not in this example because they are very low.
